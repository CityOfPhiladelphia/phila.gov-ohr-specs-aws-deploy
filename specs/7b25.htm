<h2>7B25<br>SEWER MAINTENANCE CREW CHIEF II</h2>

<hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL
DEFINITION</font></center>
<p> This is responsible sewer maintenance and repair work at the foreman level.  Work
differs from the next lower class in the series in that it entails responsibility for supervising
several small crews engaged in the various aspects of sewer maintenance and repair program. 
A significant aspect of the work includes responsibility for contacting the general public in an
effort to resolve complaints resulting from the work.  Due to the nature of the work assignments
may be performed outside of regularly scheduled working hours.
<p>  Work is performed under the general supervision of an administrative superior. 
Assignments call for evaluative thinking and are carried out according to standard sewer
maintenance practices and general work instructions.  The employee participates with other
foremen to solve sewer problems in an assigned area of the city or a functional segment of the
sewer maintenance project.  Work involves conditions which can be only partially controlled due
to outside environment and sewer conditions.  Light physical effort may be required.
