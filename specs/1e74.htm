<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>This is trainee level computer programming and analysis work.  Employees in this class perform
assignments intended to develop their skills in computer programming and analysis.  Employees assist
higher level programmer analysts and systems programmers in completion of assignments and may be
assigned to perform portions of projects.  The employees specialize in a designated computer language
within a system environment, or use one or more designated computer languages, including fourth
generation languages, or perform systems programming work.  Employees in the class are supervised by
a technical supervisor.
