<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>

This is full performance level systems programming work managing a varied data
base/telecommunications/operating systems programming projects.  Work is performed in a multi-system
computer environment that includes multiple central processing units, a mainframe computer, and a multi-
line telecommunications network.  An employee in this class coordinates and directs the activities of
lower level systems programmers and other users of the system assigned to specific phases and
components of such projects or a group of outside consultants contracted to design or install specific
computing software and/or maintain the operation and efficiency of permanently assigned complex
operation and compatible software systems, the level of which differentiates this class from that of lower
level systems programmers.  Work is performed under the direction of a technical superior.
