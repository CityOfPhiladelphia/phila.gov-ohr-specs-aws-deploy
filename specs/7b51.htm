<h1>7B51<br />WATERWAYS RESTORATION CREW CHIEF 2</h1>

</center>

<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is waterways restoration, maintenance, and repair work at the second supervisory level.  Work differs from the next lower class in the series in that it entails responsibility for supervising first level supervisors and their small crews engaged in the various aspects of waterway and stream maintenance and repair as part of the Water Department Clean Streams program.  A significant aspect of the work includes responsibility for contacting the public in an effort to resolve complaints resulting from the work.  Due to the nature of the work, assignments may be performed outside of regularly scheduled working hours. Employees solve waterway problems in an assigned area of the city or a segment of streams and tributaries. Work involves conditions, which can be only partially controlled due to outside environmental conditions.  Light physical effort may be required. Work is performed under the general supervision of an administrative superior.</p>
