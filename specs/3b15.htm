<p>
     This is electrical transit engineering work providing final review and approval of
electrical and electronic designs, plans and specifications for transit projects of considerable
scope and complexity.  Work involves supervision of a small staff of engineering personnel
engaged in electrical transit projects.  Developing design criteria for consulting electrical
engineers of a public transportation agency is a significant aspect of the work.  Work is
performed under the general direction of an administrative superior.<p>
