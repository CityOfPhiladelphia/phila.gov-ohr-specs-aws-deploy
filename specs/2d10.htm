<p>
This is paraprofessional work assisting real property evaluators gathering case facts by
records search and field investigation in order to supply information for the estimation of fair
market value of real property.  Work may be similar to, but is distinguished from that performed
by professional evaluators, by virtue of the close supervision received, the limited scope and
level of assignments, and the lesser need for the analysis of cases and the interpretation of laws
and precedents.  The employee receives training and gains experience in the methods and
techniques of real property evaluation.<p>
