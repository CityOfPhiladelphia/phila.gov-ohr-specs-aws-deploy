<h1>3A67<br />WATER PLANS DESIGNER 1</h1>


</center>

<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>This is engineering or architectural technician design work computing and drafting assigned water distribution, sewage collection or water/wastewater treatment facility plans.  Work includes participating with higher level designers and architects/engineers in the finalization of completed plans involving the recomputing of all mathematical calculations and verifying the accuracy of supporting documentation.  Employees in this class utilize computer aided drafting and design (CADD) software, when required, in making scale drawings, plans, plats and schematics of new and revised water distribution, sewage collection or water/waste-water treatment systems and plants including projects related to the architectural, civil, structural, electrical, mechanical (HVAC), instrumentation, automation, computerization and communication systems.  Work includes preparing specifications and cost estimates; reviewing change orders, shop drawings and proposed substitutions; and evaluating material samples.  This class is distinguished from other engineering/architectural support classes by the performance of the more complex assignments, greater emphasis upon independence of action and participation with higher-level design personnel in finalizing plans.   Work is performed under the direction of a technical supervisor.
