<h2>3H42<br>CRIMINALIST</h2>
</center>

<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
This is investigational laboratory work supervising and participating in the chemical, biochemical,
instrumental, microscopic and macroscopic examination of physical evidence in support of criminal investigations. 
The employee in this class develops new techniques and methods for analysis and identification of a great variety
of physical evidence and keeps abreast of and evaluates the efficacy of new methods and techniques developed
by others.  The management and supervision of a staff of subordinate chemists, technicians and clerical personnel,
and the presentation of expert testimony in criminal court are of major significance to the work.<p>
     The employee reports to the laboratory director.  The work requires analytical thinking and the selection
of methods and techniques from a variety of scientific disciplines and specialties such as chemistry, microbiology,
serology and physics.  The investigational laboratory services provided by this employee form the basis for the
resolution of criminal investigations.<p>
