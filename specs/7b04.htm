<h2>7B04<br>WATER DISTRIBUTION <nobr>SUPERVISOR I</nobr></h2>
</center>

<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL
DEFINITION</font></center>
<p> This is water distribution repair and maintenance work at the second supervisory level,
planning, assigning and recording the work in a concentrated, specialized area of water
distribution.  Work involves the supervision, through a subordinate crew chief, of a small
number of field crews engaged in either the valve maintenance, repair and replacement program;
the equipment and crew support pool; the maintenance and repair training program; or the leak
detection program.  An employee in this class serves as supervisor in a distribution district or
city-wide specialized area in the absence of the assigned supervisor.  Dealing with interdepart-
mental personnel and the public is a significant aspect of the work.  The responsibility for
supervising a subordinate crew chief and a small number of crews and the concentration of work
in one element of the water distribution program differentiate this class from that of the higher
level supervisory class.  Work is performed under the general supervision of a Water
Distribution Superintendent.  Employees in this class may be required to work evenings,
weekends and holidays as duties require.  Work may involve some disagreeable aspects.
