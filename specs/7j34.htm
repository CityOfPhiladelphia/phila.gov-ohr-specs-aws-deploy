<p>
<font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
This is skilled mechanical work in the maintenance and repair of large industrial process machinery and related equipment.  Employees in this class work in one of the City's water treatment, water pollution control or sludge processing plants or in a pumping  operation performing preventive maintenance  activities according to established schedules and corrective and emergency repair work as assigned.  Instructing other maintenance personnel in the proper maintenance methods, techniques and procedures is an aspect of the work performed.  This class is differentiated from related classes by the size and complexity of the industrial process machinery and related components such as, but not limited, to large feeding and mixing mechanisms, centrifuges and cryogenic, chemical feed and large rotating equipment and by the necessity to follow specified safety procedures due to exposure to hazardous chemical and sewage substances.
<p>
Work involves disagreeable conditions, and the lifting of heavy material.  Work is performed under the general supervision of a maintenance superior.
<p>
