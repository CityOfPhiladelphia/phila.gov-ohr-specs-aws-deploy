<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
This is full performance level electrical engineering work preparing a variety of diagrams, plans,
designs, specifications, and estimates, and inspecting and testing for the construction and installation of
electrical equipment and systems for a variety of public works projects.  Employees may conduct field
or office investigations to determine the project's compliance with sound engineering practices, designs,
contract specifications, and established standards, codes and regulations.  Work differs from the next
lower class in that assignments received from a superior define the scope of the work to be performed,
but the employee uses independent judgment in planning work details and making technical decisions. 
Work is performed under the general supervision of an engineering supervisor.<p>
