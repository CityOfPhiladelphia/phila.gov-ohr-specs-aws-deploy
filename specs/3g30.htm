<h2>3G30<br>CHEMICAL TECHNICIAN</h2>
</center>

<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p> This is technical laboratory work performing standardized routine tests on substances to
determine specified chemical and physical properties using wet chemistry and/or the less
complex instrumental techniques.  Work usually requires scheduled sampling and the execution
of repetitive tests.  Employees in this class who are assigned to testing raw and treated drinking
water or wastewater work on an assigned shift.  Work is performed under the supervision of a
technical supervisor.  Work involves some disagreeable aspects.<p>

</font></center>
<ul>
<li>Performs standardized chemical tests on raw and treated drinking water samples at
regular intervals; prescribes, on the basis of established test, the amounts of chemicals to be
added to the treatment process; notifies plant operators of test results requiring changes in
chemical treatment.
<li>Uses standardized procedures to test raw and treated water samples for alkalinity,
fluorides, taste, clarity, odor, algae, turbidity, chlorine, phosphates, manganese, pH level and
similar physical and chemical properties.
<li>Uses standardized procedures to test sludge, raw waste water, primary effluent,
chlorinated effluent and floc samples for total solids, pH levels, volatile acids, suspended solids,
dissolved oxygen content and similar physical and chemical properties.
<li>Performs standardized tests to determine quality of materials and commodities such as
water treatment chemicals, textiles, paper products, soils and sands.
<li>Performs standardized chemical tests to determine the extent and content of pollutants in
the air; determines the radioactivity of water, food and air by use of standardized radio-chemical
tests and radiation indicators.
<li>Makes chemical calculations during testing process.
<li>Uses analytical instruments such as pH meters, titrators and turbidimeters.
<li>Posts test results; may enter or retrieve information on computer terminal.
<li>Prepares necessary analytical reagents and standardized solutions; standardizes and
maintains equipment and instruments; cleans test equipment and assigned work area.
<li>Maintains records of work performed and compiles report data.
<li>Performs related work as required.</ul>
