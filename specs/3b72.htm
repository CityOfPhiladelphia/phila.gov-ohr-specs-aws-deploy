<p>
      This is supervisory engineering work directing through subordinate engineering supervisors the activities of
engineers, technicians and inspectors engaged in inspecting construction projects.  Employees in this class make final
decisions in contractual disputes and resolves complex engineering construction problems.  Supervising and coordinating
the activities of an engineering and technical staff to insure that work is performed by contractors in accordance to
approved plans and specifications are significant aspects of the work.  Work is performed under the general direction of
an administrative engineering superior.  <p>

<li>Supervises the review of plans and specifications for proposed construction projects prepared by departmental
designers or engineering consultants; determines if there are any utility or other obstructions which may interfere with
the implementation of the plans and specifications; confers with representatives of department and/or consulting firms
to resolve problems and interpret specifications.
<li>Attends pre-construction job meetings to review all aspects of construction projects; indicates priorities for the
completion of various aspects of the work; reviews sections of the plans and specifications that may present interpretation
or construction problems; determines if contractors' proposals meet structural and safety requirements; reviews and
approves all sub-contractors and materials suppliers to be used by the primary contractor in carrying out the work.
<li>Confers with engineering subordinates to assign personnel to construction projects; makes on-site inspections of
construction while in progress and upon completion;  makes changes in contracts or plans to compensate for field
conditions that do not affect engineering or design integrity of the project; stops work and confers with superior,
departmental design engineers and/or consultants to resolve changes involving engineering of design integrity of the
project; prepares change orders; makes final inspections of construction projects.
<li>Replies to a variety of correspondence from contractors, consulting engineers, governmental agencies and
organizations and others regarding the interpretation of specifications, policy determination, approval of materials and
equipment and workmanship standards; prepares correspondence to federal government regarding subsidized programs;
notifies federal agencies of work changes.
<li>Reviews and checks monthly estimates of work completed; examines estimates and reports to determine whether
all facets of construction have been adhered to before authorizing payment; reviews and approves contract work estimates
used as basis for partial payment.
<li>Supervises and reviews the preparation of drawings, engineering designs, specifications, quantity calculations,
cost estimates, engineering computations and related engineering work in the office as well as in the field.
