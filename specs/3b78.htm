<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>This is project management work in an area of engineering specialization.  The employee is responsible for developing designs, determining the necessity for contracted design services, developing cost estimates, and identifying funding sources for capital improvement programs.  Work includes preparing project designs, plans and specifications, contract documents, cost estimates, and operating budgets.  Work also includes reviewing and approving such documents prepared by outside consultants and in-house staff for adherence to engineering standards and governmental regulations.  An employee in this class is responsible for advancing capital project activities through the development phase to point of implementation, directing consultant design activities, securing and processing funding reimbursement agreements and supplements from governmental agencies, and monitoring the construction phase related to design issues.  Preparing, updating and monitoring the capital program fiscal year schedule of new construction, rehabilitation and replacement projects in an assigned engineering program are significant aspects of the work.  Work is performed under the general direction of an engineering administrator, Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner.</p>
