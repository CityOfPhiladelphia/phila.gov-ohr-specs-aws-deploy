<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
     This is beginning level electrical engineering work.  Employees in this class perform
assignments of limited but increasing scope and complexity which are intended to develop the
knowledges and abilities of the engineer.<p>
     Work is performed under the supervision of a higher level engineer.  Assignments require
evaluative thinking and are carried out in accordance with standard engineering practices and
general work instruction.  Completed work is used as a basis by others to further engineering
projects.  <p>
