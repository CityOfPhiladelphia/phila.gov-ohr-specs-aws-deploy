<p>
This is specialized analytical chemistry work utilizing mass spectrometry, or electron microscopy and infrared analysis, and a variety of analytical instruments and techniques, for forensic purposes.  The employee in this class specializes in either mass spectrometry or electron microscopy and infrared analysis and also supervises the activity of one or more subordinate chemists and/or technicians performing analysis of criminal evidence by means of chemical analysis instruments, and advises all chemists and technicians in the laboratory unit regarding the results and their interpretation.  Contact with law enforcement and court officials, and laboratory employees, and giving testimony in court concerning results of analysis, are significant aspects of the work.  Work is performed under the supervision of a technical supervisor.
