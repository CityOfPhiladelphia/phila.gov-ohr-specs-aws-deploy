<p>
     This is environmental engineering work at the full performance level with emphasis placed upon
the application of a broad knowledge of engineering mathematics, principles and practices to detect and
eliminate environmental hazards.  Work in this class differs from the next lower level in that the
employee is expected to make recommendations based on analysis and evaluation of survey data.  Contact
with plant engineers and administrators to obtain information and secure compliance with environmental
codes is a significant aspect of the work.<p>
     Work is performed under the general supervision of a technical superior.  Assignments require
evaluative thinking and are performed in accordance with standard environmental engineering practices
and applicable regulations.  Employees in this class complete assignments necessary to implement and
enforce environmental health standards.<p>
