	<h2>General Definition</h2>
		<ul class="removebullet">
		<li>This is skilled electrician work at the full performance level in one of the City's water or wastewater processing plants, water pumping stations, a Public Property facility or at the Airport.  Employees are responsible for the inspection, maintenance, and repair of 13.2KV primary distribution equipment and the alteration, installation, maintenance and repair of electrical switchgear, equipment, and fixtures.  The class is distinguished from other electrician classes by the on-going repair and maintenance of high voltage primary distribution equipment.  Work in the Airport requires the application of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations to repair and maintain electrical equipment used to guide commercial aircraft and awareness of hazards inherent in an airport environment.  Work in the Water Department and the Department of Public Property requires the application of safety standards to repair and maintain specialized equipment, which may be operated by digital and/or electronic instrumentation. Positions located in the Water department are also involved in the repair of equipment necessary for the proper operation of the plant.  Work assignments are carried out in accordance with the National Electrical Code (NEC), standard electrical practices, and general work instructions.  Employees are supervised by an Industrial Electrician Group Leader or by a maintenance supervisor.</li>
