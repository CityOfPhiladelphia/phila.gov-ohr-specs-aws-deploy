<center><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
     This is forensic laboratory work of limited scope and difficulty performing microscopic
and macroscopic examinations of organic and inorganic substances for the purpose of identifying, typing and comparing most biological evidence involved in criminal cases.  This
class is distinguished from that of the next higher level in that employees work under more direct supervision and do not perform the full scope of examinations.  Work expands in scope
and approaches the full performance level as employees gain experience in the work.  Work is performed under the supervision of a technical superior, and involves some disagreeable aspects.<p>
