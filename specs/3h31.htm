<h1>3H31<br />MASS SPECTROMETRIST</h1>

</center>

<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>This is analytical chemistry work identifying and quantifying either organic compounds by utilizing a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer or metals by utilizing an inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometer.  The employees in this class prepare samples for analysis, operate advanced instruments, and interpret test results to identify the presence of trace organic compounds or metals in the samples.  </p>
<p>Contact with other chemists to explain procedures to be followed in analyzing trace organic compounds is a significant aspect of the work.  </p>
<p>The employees work with, under specified guidelines, unknown substances that are potentially dangerous.  Work is performed under the direction of a chemistry supervisor.</p>
<p></p>
