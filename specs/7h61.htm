<p>
This is supervisory building maintenance work directing a multi-trades component of a department's building maintenance and repair program.  An employee in this class supervises, through subordinate trades supervisors, skilled, semi-skilled and full performance trades workers performing a variety of building and grounds maintenance and repair functions.  This class is differentiated from lower level supervisory trades classes by the responsibility for supervising at least three separate trades.  Work involves planning, assigning, coordinating and reviewing the work of building trades and grounds crews, insuring that work is completed in a timely and acceptable manner, and assigning priorities.  Work is performed under the general supervision of an engineering or administrative building maintenance and repair superior.
