<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p class="ind">This is supervisory industrial electrical work directing electricians and helpers engaged in alteration, installation, maintenance and repair of electrical switchgear, equipment and fixtures.  A significant aspect of the work is directing on-going maintenance and repair of high voltage primary distribution equipment.  Work in the Airport requires the application of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations to repair and maintenance of electrical equipment used to guide commercial aircraft and by hazards inherent in an airport environment.  Employees in the Water Department require the application of safety standards to repair and maintenance of electrical equipment in a water processing plant which is operated/controlled by digital and/or electronic instrumentation.  Ensuring that work assignments are carried out in accordance with applicable regulations and standard trade practices is significant to the work.  Work involves conditions which can only partially be controlled and includes light physical effort. Employees are supervised by a maintenance supervisor.</p>
