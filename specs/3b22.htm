<h2>3B22<br>MECHANICAL ENGINEER II</h2>
</center>

<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
     This is mechanical engineering work at the full performance level applying engineering knowledge
to the design and/or installation of mechanical equipment in a variety of public works.  Work includes
the preparation of designs, plans, specifications and estimates for small design projects, the design of the
more difficult phases of a major project, or the inspection for installation and/or maintenance purposes,
of major mechanical equipment.  Work differs from the next lower class in that the assignments received
define the scope of the work but the employee uses independent judgment in planning work details and
making technical decisions.  Establishing and maintaining effective work relationships with contractors,
consultants and fellow employees is a significant aspect of the work.<p>
     Work is performed under the general supervision of an engineering superior.  Assignments
require analytical thinking and are performed in accordance with accepted engineering standards and
applicable regulations.  Employees in this class work with engineers, contractors and others to complete
assigned engineering projects.

</font></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Designs the more complex phases of a major project for a variety of mechanical equipment
installations such as heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and power systems, electrostatic precipitators,
waste water or raw water pumping station and incinerator plant systems; makes difficult engineering
computations; prepares plans for the installation of complex mechanical equipment; prepares plans and
specifications including detailed cost estimates; makes field trips to secure data to be used in preparing
plans and specifications; prepares quantity lists of mechanical equipment and materials necessary for
various projects; prepares reports and recommendations on various phases of mechanical engineering
problems.
<li>Inspects installation or major alterations to mechanical equipment performed by private
contractors to insure compliance with plans and specifications; approves minor variations to plans when
field conditions warrant; may recommend halting construction when major instances of non-compliance
are noted; reviews contractors' proposed work schedules to assure the proper sequence of installation;
maintains records of work and shop drawing to determine adherence to work schedules; prepares periodic
work progress reports.
<li>Reviews mechanical phases of plans and specifications prepared by engineers to determine
accuracy and completeness of plans; checks contractors' shop drawings for compliance with technical
standards and specifications; explains and interprets specifications and requirements and refers more
complex problems to superior.
<li>May give assignments to, and supervise the work of a small number of engineers, engineering
technicians and engineering aides engaged in the preparation of designs, plans, estimates and drawings
or other related assignments.
<li>Performs related work as required.</ul><p>
