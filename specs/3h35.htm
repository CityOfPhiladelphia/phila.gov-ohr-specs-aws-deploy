<p>
             This is administrative chemistry work planning, directing and coordinating, through
subordinate supervisors, a major phase of the analytical chemistry function of the Water
Department's Bureau of Laboratory Services.  An employee in this class develops, evaluates and
determines the methodologies, personnel, and equipment required to achieve compliance with
local, state, and federal rules and regulations for inorganic or organic compound measurement
in drinking water, wastewater, sludge and industrial wastes.  Contact with representatives of
government agencies, industrial plants, and community groups is a significant aspect of the
work.  Work is performed under the direction of an administrative superior.<p>
