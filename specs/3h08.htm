<p> This is full performance agronomic work in the city's sludge management program.  An employee in
this class has responsibility for administering contracts for a group of sludge application projects and insuring
contractor compliance with specifications, agreements and federal and state environmental regulations.  Work
includes establishing environmental monitoring systems for measuring the effects of sludge applications on
soils, groundwater and crops.  Establishing and maintaining contact with representatives of governmental
agencies, community groups, educational institutions and the general public are significant aspects of the work. 
This class is distinguished form the next lower level agronomist class by responsibility for a greater range of
assignments and by independence of action in making decisions and exercising judgment.  Work is performed
under the direction of a technical superior.<p>
