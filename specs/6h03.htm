<h1>6H03<br />ZONING EXAMINER 3</h1>
</center>

<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>This is full-performance level code compliance work, examining and reviewing complex zoning and use permit applications for conformance with zoning standards.  The work is differentiated from the next lower level within the series by the increased complexity of the applications reviewed as indicated by the necessity for a considerable amount of complex mathematical calculations and the greater variety of zoning classifications entailed.  A significant aspect of the work is eliciting required information from applicants, interpreting the zoning code, and explaining code requirements to the general public or their representatives.  Work is performed under a technical or administrative supervisor. </p>
