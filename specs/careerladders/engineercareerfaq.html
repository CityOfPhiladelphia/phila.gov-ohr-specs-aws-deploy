		<p><b>How do I apply for the Graduate Engineer Examination?</b></p>
		<p>See the <a href="../../announce/howapply.htm">How To Apply For A Civil Service Exam FAQ</a></p><br />


		<p><b>Do I have to take a test to be appointed to a Graduate Engineer position?</b></p>
		<p>Yes.&nbsp;  Graduate Engineers are civil service positions, so all appointments are made from eligible lists that rank candidates according to their test scores.&nbsp;  Currently, Graduate Engineer candidates are required to take an oral examination, which is similar to a structured interview.&nbsp;  Most of the examinations are administered in the Municipal Services Building.&nbsp;  Examinations are usually administered at least once a month.</p><br />

		<p><b>Is a bachelor&#8217;s degree required to work for the City of Philadelphia as an engineer?</b></p>
		<p>All Graduate Engineers are required to have completed a bachelor&#8217;s degree program in an acceptable area of engineering to be appointed.&nbsp;  With very few exceptions, all higher level engineering classes require a bachelor&#8217;s degree in engineering.</p><br />

		<p><b>Do I have to satisfy all requirements to apply for a job as a Graduate Engineer?</b></p>
		<p>No.&nbsp;  Graduate Engineers can apply and test for City jobs up to nine months prior to graduation.&nbsp;  Candidates must graduate and meet all requirements before they can be hired.</p><br />

		<p><b>Is a professional engineer license required to work for the City of Philadelphia as an engineer?</b></p>
		<p>A professional engineer license is not required for any engineering class below the supervisory / staff technical specialist level.&nbsp;  Some, but not all supervisory / staff technical specialist classes require a professional engineer license.</p><br />


		<p><b>Are City of Philadelphia engineers represented by a union?</b></p>
		<p>Most non-supervisory and first supervisory level civil service engineers are represented by AFSCME.&nbsp;  Management level jobs are not represented by a union, but most are in the civil service.</p><br />


		<p><b>Will promotional opportunities be available?</b></p>
		<p>Yes.&nbsp;  As a practice, the City tries to fill as many jobs as possible with current employees if there is an adequate supply of qualified candidates.</p>

		<p>Promotional opportunities are announced on a bi-weekly basis.  Notices of promotional opportunities are posted on the Personnel Department website.</p>

		<p>Competition in Promotional examinations is restricted to current civil service employees.&nbsp; If an examination is announced as a departmental promotional opportunity, only the employees of that department are eligible to compete in the examination.&nbsp; When an examination is announced concurrently as both a promotional examination and as an open competitive examination for the general public, qualified City employees must be selected before outside candidates.</p>

		<p>See the <a href="index.html" title="career ladder for engineers">career ladder for engineers</a> for more information on career opportunities.</p><br />


		<p><b>Do all promotions require competitive testing?</b></p>
		<p>Graduate Engineers are eligible for promotion to the Engineer 1 level after one year of satisfactory performance and to the Engineer 2 level after another year of satisfactory performance.  Many engineers receive an additional promotion to the Engineering Specialist. Most promotions are based on an evaluation of a candidate&#8217;s training and experience (T&E). Candidates must submit an application and usually do not have to appear to take an examination.</p><br />

		<p><b>What type of testing is required for promotions?</b></p>
		<p>Competitive testing is required for most jobs above the Engineering Specialist level.  Tests are job related, and depending on the job, the test could be a multiple choice written test, an oral structured interview, an evaluation of education and experience, a work simulation test, or some combination of these standard types of tests.</p><br />
