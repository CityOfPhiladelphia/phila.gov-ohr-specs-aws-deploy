Employees are also responsible for performing basic correctional functions as required. An employee in this class performs a variety of tasks associated with the maintenance of facility climate control systems. Employees service air conditioning, refrigeration, ventilation and heating systems and related primary and peripheral utility components.  Work involves exposure to disagreeable environmental conditions and moderate physical effort. Employees report to a higher-level maintenance superior.</p>
