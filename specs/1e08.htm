</center>

<hr width="50%" /><br />
<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>

This is electronic communications project management work, planning developing and
directing the installation of a computer driven 800 MHz simulcast trunked radio system, under
the initial direction and use by the Fire Department for eventual utilization by all of the City's
operating departments.  The employee in this class is responsible for obtaining approval and
subsequent acquisition of 30 800 MHZ radio frequency channels from the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, insuring compliance with all communications regulatory agency mandates and
developing data and voice transmission capability for the city's proposed mobile and fixed
microwave radio network.  Work also includes performing systems analysis and applications
programming of various manual administrative processes and procedures for the Fire
Department's Administrative Services Unit, through mini and personal computer devices. 
Conferring with the City's Communication's Committee, directing outside consultants,
monitoring system and equipment installation for contract compliance and operating efficiency,
interacting with vendors and managing other assigned communications projects are significant
aspects of the work.  Work is performed under the general direction of the Fire Department's
