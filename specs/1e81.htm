<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p> This is supervisory level computer programming and analysis work directing, as a department's
sole supervisor, the provision of all computing services or providing across-the-board assistance to a
higher level computing manager in departments where computer hardware consists of a mini-computer
and personal computers and may also include a local area network and outside consultant support. 
Across-the-board assistants serve in departments that administer three or more computing functions, and
supervise at least four programmer or information management analysis and a technical support staff. 
Departmental sole supervisors supervise at least three programmer or information management analysts
and a technical support staff.  Supervising the development of program and department specific
applications through the mainframe of the City's Central Computing Agency is a significant aspect of the
work.  The class is differentiated from the other classes by the wider range of computing duties and by
performance of a variety of administrative duties.  This class is differentiated from the next lower level
class in the series by the size of staff supervised.  Work is performed under the general supervision of
an administrative or technical supervisor.
