<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
     This is project management work directing the implementation of engineering design and
construction phases of the City's airports' public works projects.  An employee in this class is
responsible for all project-related administrative requirements and serves as project manager for
successive design and construction projects of considerable diversity and complexity, including
but not limited to roadways, runways, taxiways, ramps and buildings.  An employee in this class
directs the activities of a staff that may be composed of engineering and/or architectural
personnel with technical support staff and outside contractors and consultants.  This class is
differentiated from other related classes by project management responsibility for both
engineering and/or architectural design and construction project components.  Work is performed
under the general direction of an administrative superior.<p>

<b>ALLOCATING FACTORS:</b>      (The following conditions must be met for a position to be
                         approved for this class.)
<ul>
<li>The position must be assigned to the City's Division of Aviation.
<li>The position must be responsible for project management of successive engineering
     design and construction capital projects of considerable diversity, complexity, involving
     multiple engineering disciplines.</ul><p>
