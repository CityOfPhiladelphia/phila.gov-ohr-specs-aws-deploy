     This is supervisory and manual work in general laboring operations.
<p>Employees in this class supervise relatively small groups of employees performing
manual duties and frequently participate in the work performed.  Work involved is routine,
repetitive, often requiring physical exertion and may involve operation of a truck.  Employees
have limited opportunity for independent judgement and decision.  Specific work or route
assignments are received from a higher level crew chief, and work is inspected frequently for
completeness and adherence to schedules.
