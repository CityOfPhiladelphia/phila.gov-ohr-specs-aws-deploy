<h1>3A68<br />WATER PLANS DESIGNER 2</h1>
</center>

<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>This is complex engineering or architectural technician design work computing and drafting new or revised water distribution, sewage collection or water/wastewater treatment plants or systems and may include responsibility for supervising other technical employees.  Employees in this class utilize computer aided drafting and design (CADD) software, when required, of new or revised water distribution, sewage collection or water/wastewater treatment plants and systems including projects related to the architectural, civil, structural, electrical, mechanical (HVAC), instrumentation, automation, computerization and communication systems.  Performing an advisory service to City officials charged with responsibility for maintaining the water distribution, sewage collection and water/wastewater treatment systems and representing the department at meetings with consultants and contractors are significant aspects of the work.  This class is distinguished from the lower-level plans designer class by greater independence of action in assignments, representing the department at meetings with consultants and contractors and performing advisory services to departmental officials.  Work is performed under the general direction of a technical superior.</p>
