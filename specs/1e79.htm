<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>
 This is supervisory level computer programming and analysis work.  Employees in this
class supervise the activities of a group of at least five subordinate programmer analysts working
in the City's central computing agency or in a department environment characterized by multiple
central processing units, a mainframe computer, a multi-line telecommunications network, and
provision of computing services by the mainframe to other city departments.  The employees
are responsible for training subordinates, assigning projects and permanent system responsibilities, and reviewing the work products of subordinates.  Employees specialize in a designated
computer language.  An important aspect of the work is insuring that work produced by the
group satisfies the computer requirements of users.  The employees are supervised by a technical
supervisor.
