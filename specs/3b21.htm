<h2>3B21<br>MECHANICAL ENGINEER I</h2>
</center>


<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
     This is mechanical engineering work preparing designs, plans, specifications and
estimates and inspecting and testing the installation and operation of mechanical equipment in
a variety of public works projects.  The employee is given increasingly difficult assignments and
is expected to use progressively more independence of judgment in planning work details,
completing preliminary designs and making technical decisions.<p>
     Work is performed under the supervision of an engineering superior.  Assignments
require evaluative thinking and are performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
and general work instructions.  Employees in this class provide interpretive and advisory
services to engineering superiors which lead to the completion of engineering projects.<p>
