<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>This is responsible supervisory police work involving the command of an assigned shift in a police
district or a specialized police unit.  Work involves responsibility for instructing and leading police officers in
their work, for assigning them duties and checking their efficiency.  Work may involve responsibility for the
supervision of special units, such as assigned shift of the traffic division or a squad of policemen on duty. 
Considerable judgment must be exercised independently in interpreting orders and in making decisions
concerning important police problems when no superior officer is readily available.  Work is performed within
the general framework of established routine and departmental rules and regulations, with changes in routine
and assistance on major problems received from a superior officer.  All work is subject to general supervision
by personal inspections, review of reports by superiors, and appraisal of the effectiveness of police work
performed by the assigned squad or detail.<p>
