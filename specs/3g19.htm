<p>
This is laboratory and field testing work at the full performance level testing various
construction materials and consumer products for conformance to accepted materials standards
and contract specifications.  Work is distinguished from the next lower level in the series by the
complexity and diversity of tests performed on a wide variety of material and consumer products
at construction sites and manufacturing plants.  Work is performed under the general supervision
of a technical superior.
