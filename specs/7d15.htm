<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p class="ind">This is second-level supervisory custodial work coordinating cleaning and general upkeep activities of public buildings and surrounding grounds.  The work differs from the next lower level in this series in that the employee supervises a larger number of workers and has responsibility for more extended areas.  A significant aspect of work involves scheduling and overseeing a large number of personnel engaged in cleaning and custodial tasks and responsibility for setting standards of cleanliness, and maintaining adequate supplies and equipment. Assignments are stable in nature and are carried out in accordance with standard practices and general work instructions.  Work involves light physical effort and may be performed in inclement weather conditions. Work is performed under the supervision of a maintenance or administrative supervisor.   </p>
