<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>
 This is complex data entry work on a computer terminal.  An employee in this class
operates a computer terminal keyboard, performing rapid and accurate keying of the more
complex coded and uncoded alpha-numeric data for entry into an electronic computing system. 
Work includes off-line key to tape, key to magnetic disc, and performing on line direct data
entry to and retrieval from a computing system database.  Work also includes occasional
assignments to the operation of related data processing and storage equipment.  Verifying
completed data entry assignments for accuracy and completeness is a significant aspect of the
work.  This class is differentiated from all other classes by the responsibility for keying data to
designated data fields for entry into the data base of an electronic computer system.  Work is
performed under the supervision of a technical superior.
