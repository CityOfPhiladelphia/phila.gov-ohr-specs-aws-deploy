<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
     This is specialized construction engineering work supervising, through technical subordinates, the
inspection of public works transit signals and communications construction projects to assure good
workmanship and contractors' adherence to plans, specifications and contract requirements.  The
employee directs the work of inspection units under his supervision and provides engineering
interpretations to resolve construction disputes.  The work may involve supervision of contracted
inspectors.<p>
     Work is performed under the direction of an engineering supervisor.  Assignments require
analytical thinking and are performed in accordance with accepted construction inspection and engineering
standards and applicable regulations.  Employees in this class participate with contractors, engineers and
technicians to insure that all transit signals and communications construction projects are completed
properly.  Work may require light physical effort.<p>
