An employee in this class participates in the development of highway construction plans and specifications, performs engineering calculations in certifying quantities of materials used, and assesses field conditions to determine the need for modifications in project plans.  Work also includes supervising, through subordinates, the inspection of street construction and major repair projects performed by private contractors for adherence to standards and the work of a number of street repair crews engaged in maintaining and repairing streets.  The incumbents in this class are routinely required to work on Saturday and occasionally in the evenings in addition to the normal 40-hour workweek due to the necessity for being present during all periods of major streets construction and winter weather related emergencies within the district(s).
