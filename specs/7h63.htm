<hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
This is administrative building maintenance work directing a comprehensive building maintenance and repair program.

Work includes reviewing subordinate supervisors' reports of work progress, devising and scheduling a preventive maintenance program, and determining building service work order priorities.  This class is differentiated from the next lower level class in the series by the supervision, through subordinate supervisors, of a large group of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled workers, the diversity in kind, number, and skill level of the work crews supervised, and the employee's overall responsibility for the department's complete building maintenance and repair program.  Work is performed under the general supervision of an administrative or technical superior.
