<h1>1E62<br />SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER</h1>

</center>

<center><hr width="50%" /><p></p><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p class="ind">This is intermediate performance level systems programming work installing and maintaining moderately complex databases/telecommunications networks/operating systems network.  Work is performed in a multi-system computer environment that includes multiple central processing units and a multi-line telecommunications network.  An employee in this class monitors and evaluates operating system efficiency and makes any required modifications and adjustments to maintain efficient system usage and operation.  Work may include systems programming responsibility for a component of large complex systems programming projects.  Maintaining operating system security and integrity and hardware configuration appropriate to assigned operating systems is a significant aspect of the work.</p>
<p class="ind">Work is performed under the supervision of a technical supervisor.</p>
