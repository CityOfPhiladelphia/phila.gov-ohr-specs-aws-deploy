<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>

This is systems and applications programming work in the operation and maintenance of
a computer system characterized by hardware based fault tolerance using duplex logic and
hardware components and VOS operating system.  The employee in this class maintains
application software programs, develops and integrates new application programs designed to
support airport activities, and enhances, monitors, and maintains operating system efficiency. 
The employee serves as a department's sole systems and applications programmer.  Work is
performed under the direction of an administrative superior.
