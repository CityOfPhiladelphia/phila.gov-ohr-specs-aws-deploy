<p>
     This is environmental engineering work investigating environmental health hazards such
as air pollution sources, noise pollution sources, occupational hazards, sources of radiation and
other potential environmental hazards to determine the extent of pollutant emissions and of
compliance with regulations.  The employee is given progressively more difficult field and/or
office assignments and is expected to use progressively more independent judgment in planning
work details and making technical decisions.<p>
     Work is performed under the supervision of a technical superior.  Assignments require
evaluative thinking and are performed in accordance with environmental engineering practices
and general work instructions.  Employees in this class provide interpretive and advisory
services to technical superiors which lead to the completion of engineering projects.<p>
