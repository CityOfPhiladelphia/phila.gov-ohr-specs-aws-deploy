<p>

This is full performance level computer programming and analysis work.  Employees in
this class are assigned the most complex computer analysis and programming projects and are
expected to complete assignments and resolve problems with limited direction.  Employees are
assigned permanent systems responsibilities and satisfy computer requirements of users. 
Employees specialize in a designated computer language, or use one or more designated
computer languages, including fourth generation languages.  Employees work in environments
in which there is at least a mini-computer and employees working in that environment may serve
as the department's only computer programmer analyst.  An employee serving as a department's
sole programmer analyst is directed by an administrative supervisor.  Employees in other
environments work under the direction of a technical supervisor.
