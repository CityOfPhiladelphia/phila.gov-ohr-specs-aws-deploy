<center><hr width=50%><p><font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p> This is work of limited scope and difficulty analyzing forms management systems or
records management systems.  An employee in this class is responsible for analyzing forms
management systems, determining changes needed, revising and consolidating existing forms,
and developing new forms to meet the needs of the departments; or examining, designing, and
implementing records management procedures and systems.  Included in the work is the
consultation with departmental officials to determine their requirements and implementing
recommendations for the use of new, revised and consolidated forms and records.  The work
at this level is distinguished from that of the next higher class by the generally less complex
nature of the work, and by the relatively greater degree of supervision received as part of the
continuing training for the next higher class.  The employees are supervised by the Chief of
Forms and Records Management.
