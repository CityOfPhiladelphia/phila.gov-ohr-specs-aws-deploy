</center>

<hr width="50%" /><br />
<p align="center"><font size="+1">GENERAL DEFINITION</font></p>

<p>
This is supervisory level systems programming work installing and maintaining data bases/telecommunications
network/operating systems and supervising subordinate systems programmers engaged in such work.  Work is performed in a multi-
system computer environment that includes multiple central processing units, a mainframe computer and a multi-line telecommunica-
tions network.  An employee in this class is responsible for maintaining efficient databases/telecommunications network/operating
systems hardware and software configurations through monitoring, testing and modifying installed systems, trouble shooting and
diagnosing system malfunctions, and providing problem resolutions.  Keeping the entire system up and operating efficiently and
insuring that the security and the integrity of the systems and databases are protected are significant aspects of the work.  Work is
performed under the direction of a technical superior.
