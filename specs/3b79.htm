<p>
This is project management work directing the planning and implementation of architectural and/or engineering design and construction phases of projects in a designated specialty area.  An employee in this class is responsible for all project-related administrative requirements and serves as project manager for successive design and construction projects of considerable diversity and complexity.  The employee directs the activities of a staff that may be composed of engineering and/or architectural personnel with technical support staff and outside contracts and consultants.
<p>
Work includes preparing, reviewing and approving designs, plans, specifications and contract documents, resolving construction contract disputes, and rendering final inspection and approval of completed construction work.  This class is differentiated from other related classes by project management responsibility for both engineering and/or architectural design and
construction project components.  Coordinating the activities of a multi-disciplined staff that may change in
size and composition from project to project is a significant aspect of the work.  Work is performed under the general direction of an administrative superior.
