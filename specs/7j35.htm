<p>
<font size=+1>GENERAL DEFINITION</font></center>
<p>
This is supervisory mechanical work in the maintenance and repair of large industrial process machinery and related equipment.  An employee in this class plans, assigns and reviews the work of subordinate personnel working in one of the City's water treatment, water pollution control or sludge processing plants or in a pumping station operation.  Significant to the work is the allocation and deployment of subordinate staff with the objective of maximizing the efficiency of maintenance and repair activities.  This class is differentiated from other supervisory mechanical maintenance classes by the supervision of skilled mechanics maintaining and repairing large and complex industrial process machinery such as, but not limited to, large feeding and mixing mechanisms, centrifuges and cryogenic, chemical feed and large rotating equipment, and by the responsibility for assuring staff adherence to specified safety procedures due to hazardous chemical and sewage substances.
<p>
Work involves some disagreeable conditions and the lifting of heavy material.  Work is performed under the supervision of a maintenance superior.
